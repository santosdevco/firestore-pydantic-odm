# Firestore Pydantic ODM

**Firestore Pydantic ODM** is a lightweight, fully-typed Object-Document Mapper for **Google Cloud Firestore**.  
It combines [Pydantic]’s data-validation super-powers with Firestore’s scalable NoSQL store, offering async CRUD, batch writes, transactions, and **projections that request only the fields you need**—making queries faster and cheaper.

---

## Features

* **Asynchronous CRUD:** Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting Firestore documents using `async/await`.
* **Validation with Pydantic:** Define your data models with automatic validation, ensuring data integrity before it reaches the database.
* **Advanced Queries:** Perform searches with filters, projections (selecting only specific fields), and ordering.
* **Batch Operations and Transactions:** Group multiple write operations and execute transactions atomically for greater efficiency and consistency.
* **Emulator and Testing Support:** Easily switch to the Firestore emulator or plug in mocks for unit testing.
* **Seamless Integration:** Fits smoothly into any Python project with minimal setup.

## Installation

```bash
pip install firestore-pydantic-odm
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1 · Define a model

```python
from firestore_pydantic_odm import BaseFirestoreModel

class User(BaseFirestoreModel):
    class Settings:
        name = "users"      # Firestore collection name

    name: str
    email: str
```

### 2 · Initialise Firestore

```python
from firestore_pydantic_odm import FirestoreDB, BaseFirestoreModel

db = FirestoreDB(project_id="my-project", emulator_host="localhost:8080")  # optional emulator
BaseFirestoreModel.initialize_db(db)
```

### 3 · Async CRUD

```python
user = User(name="Alice", email="alice@example.com")
await user.save()               # CREATE

user.email = "alice@new.com"
await user.update()             # UPDATE

await user.delete()             # DELETE
```

### 4 · Querying & Projections

```python
# Simple filter
async for u in User.find(filters=[User.name == "Alice"]):
    print(u)

# Single document
u = await User.find_one(filters=[User.email == "alice@new.com"])
```

#### Projections — selecting only the fields you need

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class UserProjection(BaseModel):
    name: str            # only grab the `name` field

async for u in User.find(
        filters=[User.age >= 18],
        projection=UserProjection):
    print(u.name)        # `u` is an instance of UserProjection

# Fetch a single document with a projection
u = await User.find_one(
        filters=[User.id == "abc123"],
        projection=UserProjection)
```

> **How it works:** the ODM converts `UserProjection` into a Firestore **field mask**, so the RPC fetches *only* the columns defined in that class.
> Each item yielded by `find()` (or returned by `find_one()`) is therefore of type **`UserProjection`**, giving you a clean `List[UserProjection]` with exactly the data requested.

### 5 · Batch writes

```python
from firestore_pydantic_odm import BatchOperation

ops = [
    (BatchOperation.CREATE, User(name="Bob", email="bob@example.com")),
    (BatchOperation.UPDATE, user),            # previously fetched instance
    (BatchOperation.DELETE, another_user)     # instance with `id` set
]
await User.batch_write(ops)
```

---

## Testing

The project ships with `pytest` and `pytest-asyncio` fixtures. To run the suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Set `FIRESTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:8080` to run tests against the local emulator instead of production Firestore.
